## Research

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?

To develop a robust character creation system that utilizes design patterns effectively, I conducted comprehensive research on the following areas:

1. **Factory Design Pattern**: Understanding how the Factory Pattern can be used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

2. **Decorator Design Pattern**: Learning how the Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

3. **Character Stats and Item Systems in Games**: Investigating how role-playing games (RPGs) implement character stats and how equipping items can modify these stats.

## Implementation

### What was the process of completing the task? What influenced your decision making?

**Initial Planning:**

- **Understanding Requirements:**

  - **Factory Pattern:** Required for creating characters based on their class.
  - **Decorator Pattern:** Used to modify character stats dynamically through items.
  - **Character Stats:** Core stats like strength, agility, endurance, etc.
  - **Item Effects:** Items should modify stats and effects should stack properly.

- **Language Selection:** Chose C++ due to its object-oriented capabilities and performance benefits in game development.

**Development Steps:**

1. **Defining Enumerations:**

   - **CharacterClass Enum:**

     ```cpp
     enum class CharacterClass
     {
         Warrior,
         Rogue,
         Mage,
         Wizard,
         Ranger,
         Monk,
         Bard,
         Paladin,
         Cleric
     };
     ```

     *Figure 1: Enumeration for character classes.*

2. **Creating the Base Character Class:**

   - **Character Class:**

     ```cpp
     class Character
     {
     public:
         std::string name;
         CharacterClass characterClass;
         int strength, agility, endurance, intelligence, willpower, speed, luck;

         Character(std::string n, CharacterClass c)
             : name(n), characterClass(c), strength(5), agility(5), endurance(5),
               intelligence(5), willpower(5), speed(5), luck(5) { }

          virtual void PrintCharacterInfo()
          {
              std::cout << "Name: " << name << ", Class: " << static_cast<int>(characterClass) << std::endl;
              std::cout << "Strength: " << strength << ", Agility: " << agility
                  << ", Endurance: " << endurance << ", Intelligence: " << intelligence
                  << ", Willpower: " << willpower << ", Speed: " << speed
                  << ", Luck: " << luck << std::endl;
          }

         virtual ~Character() = default;
     };
     ```

     *Figure 2: Base `Character` class with core stats and a method to print character info.*

3. **Implementing the Factory Pattern:**

   - **CharacterFactory Class:**

     ```cpp
     class CharacterFactory
     {
     public:
         static Character* CreateCharacter(const std::string& name, CharacterClass charClass)
         {
             Character* character = new Character(name, charClass);

             switch (charClass)
             {
                 case CharacterClass::Warrior:
                     character->strength = 10;
                     character->intelligence = 3;
                     break;
                 // Additional cases for other classes...
                 default:
                     // Default stats
                     break;
             }

             return character;
         }
     };
     ```

     *Figure 3: `CharacterFactory` class using the Factory Pattern to create characters based on class.*

   - **Decision Making:**

     - The Factory Pattern allows for encapsulation of object creation, making it easy to manage character creation logic in one place.
     - This pattern provides flexibility to add new character classes without modifying existing code significantly.

4. **Implementing the Decorator Pattern:**

   - **CharacterDecorator Class:**

     ```cpp
     class CharacterDecorator : public Character
     {
     protected:
         Character* character;

     public:
         CharacterDecorator(Character* c) : Character(c->name, c->characterClass), character(c) { }

         virtual void PrintCharacterInfo() override
         {
             character->PrintCharacterInfo();
         }
     };
     ```

     *Figure 4: Base `CharacterDecorator` class inheriting from `Character`.*

   - **Concrete Decorators:**

     - **SwordDecorator:**

       ```cpp
       class SwordDecorator : public CharacterDecorator
       {
       public:
           SwordDecorator(Character* c) : CharacterDecorator(c)
           {
               this->character->strength += 1;
           }
       };
       ```

     - **ShieldDecorator:**

       ```cpp
       class ShieldDecorator : public CharacterDecorator
       {
       public:
           ShieldDecorator(Character* c) : CharacterDecorator(c)
           {
               this->character->endurance += 1;
           }
       };
       ```

     - **RingDecorator:**

       ```cpp
       class RingDecorator : public CharacterDecorator
       {
       public:
           RingDecorator(Character* c) : CharacterDecorator(c)
           {
               this->character->luck += 5;
           }
       };
       ```

     *Figure 5: Concrete decorators modifying character stats by equipping items.*

   - **Decision Making:**

     - The Decorator Pattern allows adding responsibilities to objects dynamically, which is ideal for equipping items that modify stats.
     - This pattern supports stacking effects, as multiple decorators can wrap the same character object.

5. **Creating and Modifying Characters:**

   - **Main Function:**

     ```cpp
        int main()
        {
            // Task for student: Create a character using the factory and apply decorators

            CharacterFactory* factory = new CharacterFactory();

            Character* char1 = factory->CreateCharacter("Charles", CharacterClass::Cleric);
            char1->PrintCharacterInfo();

            Character* charMod1 = new SwordDecorator(char1);
            charMod1->PrintCharacterInfo();

            Character* charMod2 = new ShieldDecorator(char1);
            charMod2->PrintCharacterInfo();

            Character* charMod3 = new RingDecorator(char1);
            charMod3->PrintCharacterInfo();
            return 0;
        }

     ```

     *Figure 6: Creating a character and applying multiple decorators to modify stats.*

   - **Stacking Effects:**

     - By wrapping the character object with multiple decorators, the stat modifications stack appropriately.
     - The final call to `PrintCharacterInfo` reflects all the stat changes from the equipped items.

### What creative or technical approaches did you use or try, and how did this contribute to the outcome?

**Use of Polymorphism and Inheritance:**

- Leveraged inheritance to allow decorators to be treated as characters, enabling seamless integration when equipping items.

**Dynamic Memory Management:**

- Used dynamic allocation (`new` and `delete`) for characters and decorators to manage object lifetimes effectively.

**Ensuring Proper Cleanup:**

- Implemented destructors and ensured that allocated memory is freed to prevent memory leaks.

**Extensibility:**

- The design allows for easy addition of new character classes and items without significant changes to existing code.

- Example: Adding a new `EnchantedArmorDecorator` would involve creating a new class inheriting from `CharacterDecorator`.

**Code Readability and Organization:**

- Used clear naming conventions and organized code into logical sections for maintainability.

### Did you have any technical difficulties? If so, what were they and did you manage to overcome them?

**Challenges:**

1. **Stacking Decorators Properly:**

   - **Issue:** Initially, stat modifications were not stacking correctly when multiple decorators were applied.
   - **Solution:** Realized that each decorator needs to wrap the previous one, updating the `character` pointer accordingly.

     ```cpp
     char1 = new SwordDecorator(char1);
     char1 = new ShieldDecorator(char1);
     ```

     *Figure 7: Correctly stacking decorators by reassigning `char1`.*

2. **Memory Leaks:**

   - **Issue:** Potential memory leaks due to not deleting all allocated objects.
   - **Solution:** Ensured that all dynamically allocated memory is properly deleted.

     ```cpp
     delete char1;
     ```

     *Figure 8: Deleting the character object to free memory.*

3. **Printing Correct Stats:**

   - **Issue:** The `PrintCharacterInfo` method was not reflecting the updated stats from decorators.
   - **Solution:** Modified the `CharacterDecorator` to override `PrintCharacterInfo` and ensure it calls the decorated character's method.

## Outcome

**Final Implementation:**

- A character creation system using the Factory Pattern to instantiate characters with class-specific stats.

- Use of the Decorator Pattern to equip items that dynamically modify character stats, with effects stacking properly.

**Sample Output:**

```
Name: Charles, Class: Cleric
Strength: 5, Agility: 5, Endurance: 5, Intelligence: 5, Willpower: 88, Speed: 5, Luck: 5

Name: Charles, Class: Cleric
Strength: 6, Agility: 5, Endurance: 6, Intelligence: 5, Willpower: 88, Speed: 5, Luck: 10
```

*Figure 10: Output showing the character's stats before and after equipping items.*

**Achievements:**

- **Requirements Fulfilled:**

  - Characters can hold and equip items that modify stats.
  - Factory Pattern used for character creation based on class.
  - Decorator Pattern used for modifying stats through items.
  - Core stats are present and affected by items.
  - Multiple item effects stack correctly.

- **Extensibility:**

  - New character classes and items can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

- **Code Quality:**

  - Organized, maintainable, and follows object-oriented principles.

## Critical Reflection

### What did or did not work well and why?

**What Worked Well:**

- **Design Patterns Implementation:**

  - The Factory and Decorator Patterns fit the requirements perfectly, providing a clean and efficient solution.

- **Stat Modification and Stacking:**

  - Using decorators allowed for dynamic and stackable stat modifications, enhancing the system's flexibility.

- **Code Organization:**

  - Separating concerns and following object-oriented principles resulted in readable and maintainable code.

**What Did Not Work Well:**

- **Initial Confusion with Decorator Pattern:**

  - Understanding how to properly implement and stack decorators required careful consideration.

- **Memory Management:**

  - Managing dynamic memory introduced complexity and potential for leaks.

- **Enum Output:**

  - Directly outputting enums was not user-friendly, necessitating additional functions for better display.

### What would you do differently next time?

- **Implement Smart Pointers:**

  - Use smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`) to manage memory automatically and prevent leaks.

- **Enhance the Item System:**

  - Create an `Item` class hierarchy to represent different items, allowing characters to equip multiple items more naturally.

- **Use of Polymorphism for Items:**

  - Instead of decorators, consider using an `Equipable` interface or base class to manage items and their effects.

- **User Interface Improvements:**

  - Develop a more interactive interface for character creation and item equipping, possibly with user input.

- **Error Handling:**

  - Add comprehensive error handling and input validation to make the system more robust.

By reflecting on these aspects, I recognize the importance of careful planning when implementing design patterns and the value of modern C++ features like smart pointers for memory management.
