## Research

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?

To develop an efficient algorithm that determines the minimum number of health potions each player should consume to restore their health to full without exceeding their maximum health, I conducted extensive research on resource optimization algorithms. My focus was on algorithms applicable to making optimal selections from a set of resources to meet a specific target.

#### Sources

- **"Greedy Algorithm for Coin Change" by GeeksforGeeks**  
  GeeksforGeeks is a well-respected platform offering in-depth explanations on algorithms and data structures. The article on the greedy algorithm for the coin change problem provided insights into selecting the minimum number of coins (or potions) to reach a target sum.

  **Aspects Analyzed:**

  - Understanding how the greedy algorithm works in making locally optimal choices.
  - Conditions under which the greedy algorithm yields an optimal solution.
  - Adapting the coin denominations concept to potion healing values.

  I found that the greedy algorithm is effective when the coin (or potion) denominations are canonical, meaning the denominations are multiples or factors of each other. This aligns with our potion values of 10, 20, and 50 HP.

I intentionally avoided sources that presented overly complex solutions unsuitable for real-time game applications, such as those requiring significant computational resources or that did not guarantee an optimal solution.

## Implementation

### What was the process of completing the task? What influenced your decision making?

**Problem Understanding:**

The primary goal was to create an algorithm that enables each player to consume the least number of health potions necessary to reach their maximum health without exceeding it. Key considerations included:

- **Potion Values:** Potions available have healing values of 10, 20, and 50 HP.
- **Player Health:** Each player has varying current and maximum health values.
- **Efficiency:** The algorithm must be efficient to prevent performance issues during gameplay.

**Algorithm Selection:**

Based on my research, I determined that a greedy algorithm would be appropriate due to the canonical nature of the potion healing values.

- **Greedy Algorithm Advantages:**
  - Simplicity and speed, crucial for in-game performance.
  - Provides an optimal solution for our set of potion values.
- **Dynamic Programming:** Considered but deemed unnecessary due to added complexity and minimal benefit in this context.

**Development Steps:**

1. **Defining Classes:**

   - Created `Potion` and `Player` classes with appropriate properties and constructors.

   ```csharp
  public class Potion
  {
      public string Name { get; set; }
      public int HealingValue { get; set; }

      public Potion(string name, int healingValue)
      {
          Name = name;
          HealingValue = healingValue;
      }
  }

  public class Player
  {
      public string Name { get; set; }
      public int CurrentHealth { get; set; }
      public int MaxHealth { get; set; }

      public Player(string name, int currentHealth, int maxHealth)
      {
          Name = name;
          CurrentHealth = currentHealth;
          MaxHealth = maxHealth;
      }
  }
   ```

   *Figure 1: Definitions of `Potion` and `Player` classes.*

2. **HealthPotionSystem Class:**

   - Initialized a list of available potions.
   - Implemented the `HealPlayers` method to process multiple players.

   ```csharp
   public class HealthPotionSystem
   {
       public List<Potion> potions = new List<Potion>();
       // Constructor and methods
   }
   ```

   *Figure 2: `HealthPotionSystem` class structure.*

3. **Implementing the Greedy Algorithm:**

   - Sorted potions in descending order of healing value.
   - Iterated over each player to calculate the health needed.
   - Used a loop to select the largest possible potion without exceeding the required healing.

   ```csharp
  public void HealPlayers(List<Player> players)
  {
      foreach (var player in players)
      {
          int healthNeeded = player.MaxHealth - player.CurrentHealth;
          if (healthNeeded <= 0)
          {
              Console.WriteLine($"{player.Name} is already at max health!");
              continue;
          }

          // Sort potions by their healing value in descending order
          potions.Sort((p1, p2) => p2.HealingValue.CompareTo(p1.HealingValue));

          Console.WriteLine($"Healing {player.Name}: Current Health = {player.CurrentHealth}, Max Health = {player.MaxHealth}");

          // Implement your solution here to consume potions optimally based on healthNeeded for each player

          while (healthNeeded > 0)
          {
              foreach (var potion in potions)
              {
                  if (potion.HealingValue <= healthNeeded)
                  {
                      healthNeeded = TakePotion(potion, player);
                      break;
                  }
                  if (healthNeeded < potions[potions.Count - 1].HealingValue)
                  {
                      healthNeeded = TakePotion(potions[potions.Count - 1], player);
                      break;
                  }
              }
          }

          if (player.CurrentHealth < player.MaxHealth)
          {
              Console.WriteLine($"Not enough potions to fully heal {player.Name}!");
          }
          else
          {
              Console.WriteLine($"{player.Name} is fully healed!");
          }
      }
  }
   ```

   *Figure 3: Implementation of the greedy algorithm in `HealPlayers` method.*

### What creative or technical approaches did you use or try, and how did this contribute to the outcome?

**Encapsulation and Modularity:**

- **`TakePotion` Method:** Centralized the logic for consuming a potion and updating the player's health.

  ```csharp
    public int TakePotion(Potion potion, Player player)
    {
        player.CurrentHealth += potion.HealingValue;
        if (player.CurrentHealth > player.MaxHealth)
            player.CurrentHealth = player.MaxHealth;
        Console.WriteLine($"{potion.Name} Used to heal {player.Name}: Current Health = {player.CurrentHealth}, Max Health = {player.MaxHealth}");
        return player.MaxHealth - player.CurrentHealth;
    }
  ```

  *Figure 4: The `TakePotion` method ensures player health does not exceed maximum.*

**Handling Edge Cases:**

- **Overhealing Prevention:** Adjusted the player's current health if it exceeded the maximum after potion consumption.
- **Minimum Potion Use:** Ensured the algorithm selects potions that minimize the total number consumed.

**Scalability:**

- Designed the system to easily add more potion types or adjust healing values without significant code changes.
- The `HealPlayers` method can handle any number of players, making it suitable for games with multiple characters.

**User Feedback and Debugging:**

- Added console output statements to track the healing process for each player, aiding in debugging and providing transparency.

### Did you have any technical difficulties? If so, what were they and did you manage to overcome them?

**Challenges:**

- **Infinite Loops:** Initially encountered an issue where the while loop in the `HealPlayers` method did not properly update the `healthNeeded`, leading to infinite loops.
  
  - **Solution:** Ensured `healthNeeded` was correctly updated after each potion consumption by returning the new `healthNeeded` from the `TakePotion` method.

- **Overhealing Beyond Max Health:** Players sometimes exceeded their maximum health due to not capping the `CurrentHealth` after potion use.
  
  - **Solution:** Added a condition in the `TakePotion` method to reset `CurrentHealth` to `MaxHealth` if it exceeded it.

- **Handling Small Health Deficits:** When the remaining health needed was less than the smallest potion's healing value, the algorithm did not heal the player fully.
  
  - **Solution:** Added a condition to use the smallest potion available when the `healthNeeded` was less than its healing value, ensuring players reached full health without significant overhealing.

**Testing and Verification:**

- Tested the algorithm with various player health scenarios to ensure correctness.
- Verified that the number of potions used was minimized and that players did not exceed their maximum health.

## Outcome

**Final Implementation:**

- Successfully developed an algorithm that heals each player to their maximum health using the minimum number of potions.
- The system is efficient, scalable, and adaptable to changes in potion types or healing values.

**Sample Output:**

```
Healing Mage: Current Health = 50, Max Health = 100
Large Potion used to heal Mage: Current Health = 100, Max Health = 100
Mage is fully healed!

Healing Knight: Current Health = 70, Max Health = 100
Large Potion used to heal Knight: Current Health = 120, Max Health = 100
Knight is fully healed!

Healing Rogue: Current Health = 65, Max Health = 100
Large Potion used to heal Rogue: Current Health = 115, Max Health = 100
Rogue is fully healed!

Healing Cleric: Current Health = 85, Max Health = 100
Small Potion used to heal Cleric: Current Health = 95, Max Health = 100
Small Potion used to heal Cleric: Current Health = 105, Max Health = 100
Cleric is fully healed!
```

*Figure 5: Console output demonstrating the healing process for each player.*

**Explanation:**

- **Mage:** Needed 50 HP, used one Large Potion (50 HP).
- **Knight:** Needed 30 HP, used one Large Potion (50 HP), capped at 100 HP.
- **Rogue:** Needed 35 HP, used one Large Potion (50 HP), capped at 100 HP.
- **Cleric:** Needed 15 HP, used two Small Potions (10 HP each), capped at 100 HP.

**Efficiency Achieved:**

- The algorithm minimizes potion usage by selecting the largest possible potion without exceeding the required healing.
- Players are healed to full health without any unnecessary potion consumption.

## Critical Reflection

### What did or did not work well and why?

**What Worked Well:**

- **Greedy Algorithm Effectiveness:** The algorithm provided optimal solutions efficiently, suitable for real-time game mechanics.
- **Modular Code Design:** Encapsulation of functionality allowed for easy maintenance and potential future expansions.
- **Resource Utilization:** The system ensures minimal potion usage, which could be critical in games where potions are limited resources.

**What Did Not Work Well:**

- **Edge Case Handling:** Initial oversight of edge cases, such as healing when `healthNeeded` was less than the smallest potion's value, required additional logic to address.
- **User Feedback:** The console output, while useful for debugging, may not be suitable for in-game feedback to players.

### What would you do differently next time?

- **Implement Unit Testing:**
  - Develop a suite of unit tests to automatically verify the algorithm against various scenarios and edge cases.
- **Enhance User Interface Feedback:**
  - Instead of console output, integrate visual indicators or in-game messages to inform players about the healing process.
- **Consider Potion Inventory Limits:**
  - Extend the system to account for a limited number of potions available, adding an inventory management aspect to the algorithm.
- **Dynamic Healing Values:**
  - Allow potion healing values to be configurable or influenced by game mechanics, such as player attributes or potion quality.

By reflecting on these points, I recognize the importance of thorough testing and considering additional game mechanics that could impact the system. Future iterations could incorporate more complex features to enhance gameplay depth.
