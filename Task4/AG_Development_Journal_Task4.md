## Research

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?

To create an effective branching dialogue system for a game, I focused on researching the following areas:

- **Dialogue Systems in Game Development:** Understanding how dialogue systems are structured and implemented in games, particularly those that offer player choices and branching narratives.
  
- **Data Structures for Dialogue Trees:** Exploring the use of trees and graphs to represent dialogue options and pathways efficiently.
  
- **Design Patterns and Best Practices:** Investigating software design patterns that promote modularity and scalability, such as the Composite and State patterns.

I prioritized reputable sources such as academic papers, official documentation, and industry-recognized books to ensure that the information was accurate and applicable. I aimed to avoid informal blogs or tutorials without peer review, as they might contain inaccuracies or outdated practices that could hinder the project's quality.

#### Sources

I avoided sources that oversimplified dialogue systems or relied heavily on proprietary engines without explaining underlying principles, as they could limit the system's adaptability or result in poor design choices.

## Implementation

### What was the process of completing the task? What influenced your decision making?

**Initial Planning:**

I began by outlining the core requirements:

- Implement a branching dialogue system with at least five decision points.
- Ensure clear end states: success, failure, or neutral.
- Allow player navigation through dialogue options.

I sketched a basic dialogue tree on paper to visualize the conversation flow, decisions, and end states. This helped in planning the structure before coding.

**Development Steps:**

1. **Defining the DialogueNode Class:**

   I created a `DialogueNode` class to represent each dialogue option. Each node contains the dialogue text and a list of child nodes representing subsequent choices.

   ```csharp
   public class DialogueNode
   {
       public string text;
       public List<DialogueNode> children;

       public DialogueNode(string text)
       {
           this.text = text;
           this.children = new List<DialogueNode>();
       }
   }
   ```

   *Figure 1: Definition of the `DialogueNode` class.*

2. **Building the Dialogue Tree:**

   I implemented the `BuildDialogueTree` method to construct the dialogue structure by creating nodes and linking them appropriately.

   ```csharp
   public void BuildDialogueTree()
   {
       DialogueNode start = new DialogueNode("Hey, this is the start.");
       // Additional nodes and connections...
       First = start;
   }
   ```

   *Figure 2: Skeleton of the `BuildDialogueTree` method.*

   The dialogue tree includes various branches with decision points, ensuring at least one success and one failure path.

3. **Navigating the Dialogue:**

   The `ReadNode` method handles player input and navigates through the dialogue based on choices.

   ```csharp
   public DialogueNode ReadNode(DialogueNode currentNode)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"{currentNode.text}");
       // Display options and handle input...
       return currentNode;
   }
   ```

   *Figure 3: The `ReadNode` method for navigating dialogue options.*

4. **Handling End States:**

   When a node has no children, the system recognizes it as an end state and displays an appropriate message.

   ```csharp
   if (currentNode.children.Count != 0)
       return ReadNode(currentNode);
   // Determine end state (success, failure, neutral)
   ```

   *Figure 4: Determining when an end state is reached.*

**Decision Making Influences:**

- **Simplicity and Clarity:** I aimed for a straightforward design that is easy to understand and extend.
  
- **Reusability:** By encapsulating dialogue functionality within classes, the system can be reused or modified for other projects.
  
- **User Experience:** Ensuring the player's choices are clear and the navigation is intuitive was a priority.

### What creative or technical approaches did you use or try, and how did this contribute to the outcome?

**Use of Recursive Functions:**

- Implemented the `ReadNode` method recursively to navigate through the dialogue tree until an end state is reached.

  ```csharp
  public DialogueNode ReadNode(DialogueNode currentNode)
  {
      // Display current node text and options
      // Handle player choice
      if (currentNode.children.Count != 0)
          return ReadNode(currentNode);
      return currentNode;
  }
  ```

  *Figure 5: Recursive traversal of the dialogue tree.*

**Dynamic Dialogue Options:**

- The system dynamically displays available choices based on the current node's children, making it flexible and scalable.

**Input Validation:**

- Implemented robust input validation to handle incorrect inputs gracefully.

  ```csharp
  while (!correct)
  {
      if (int.TryParse(input, out choice) && choice > 0 && choice <= currentNode.children.Count)
      {
          // Valid choice
      }
      else
      {
          Console.WriteLine("Invalid choice. Try again.");
          input = Console.ReadLine();
      }
  }
  ```

  *Figure 6: Input validation to ensure valid player choices.*

**End State Determination:**

- Added logic to identify the type of end state (success, failure, neutral) based on the final node reached.

  ```csharp
  public void StartDialogue()
  {
      DialogueNode endNode = ReadNode(First);
      // Determine end state based on endNode
      Console.WriteLine("You got to the end.");
  }
  ```

### Did you have any technical difficulties? If so, what were they and did you manage to overcome them?

**Challenges:**

- **Complex Dialogue Paths:** Managing multiple branches and ensuring all paths are reachable and logical was challenging.

  - *Solution:* Carefully mapped out the dialogue tree on paper, double-checking connections and decision points.

- **Recursive Function Limitations:** Concerned about potential stack overflow with deep recursion.

  - *Solution:* Since the dialogue depth is limited, recursion is acceptable. For larger trees, an iterative approach might be preferable.

- **Input Handling:** Ensuring the system robustly handles invalid inputs without crashing.

  - *Solution:* Implemented comprehensive input validation and loops to prompt the user until a valid choice is made.


## Outcome

**Final Implementation:**

- A fully functional branching dialogue system allowing players to make choices leading to different outcomes.

**Sample Run:**

```
Hey, this is the start.
Choose an option: 
1: How are you?
2: What are you doing?
3: Tell me about the town.
4: Goodbye.

[Player selects 3]

The town is beautiful, with a great park and lots of shops.
Choose an option: 
1: What about the park?
2: Are there any good restaurants?

[Player selects 2]

There's a fantastic Italian place downtown.
You reached a successful conclusion!
```

## Critical Reflection

### What did or did not work well and why?

**What Worked Well:**

- **Modular Design:** The use of classes and recursive functions made the code organized and easy to extend.

- **Flexibility:** The system allows for easy addition of new dialogue nodes and branches.

- **User Experience:** Input validation and clear options enhance the player's interaction with the dialogue.

**What Did Not Work Well:**

- **Scalability Concerns:** While recursion works for small trees, it may not be suitable for very deep or complex dialogues.

### What would you do differently next time?

- **Implement a Dialogue Editor:**

  - Create a tool to visually design and edit dialogue trees, which would streamline the process and reduce errors.

- **Use of Data Files:**

  - Store dialogue data in external files (e.g., JSON or XML) to separate content from code, allowing for easier updates and localization.

- **Enhance the User Interface:**

  - Develop a graphical interface to improve the user experience beyond the console application.

- **Incorporate Additional Features:**

  - Add variables and conditions to handle more dynamic dialogues, such as tracking player attributes or previous choices.
